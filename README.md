Hello! I make tools to make it easy to get into web development.

To learn more about my projects, check out [xz/new.css](https://github.com/xz/new.css) and [xz/fonts](https://github.com/xz/fonts).

> [!NOTE]
> You may find existing projects linked to my old username, `@3x`. I had to change this username recently to make Github usable again!

> <p>I originally chose the username <code>@3x</code> as a nod to the @1x, @2x, @3x image resolution scale factor used in application development <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images#Resolution">(more about that here)</a>. The choice of this username had the unfortunate side effect of Github automatically subscribing me to any issue, pull request, or commit where the string "@3x" was mentioned, which ended up being dozens of times every day. For years I just ignored these notifications, but eventually realized I was missing instances of people intentionally trying to get my attention.</p>
> <p>Changing my username has unfortunately broken some links to my older projects, but I am now able my notifications again. :)</p></details>
